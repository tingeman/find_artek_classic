	We demonstrate for Scandinavia that both lowland permafrost in palsas

	are at temperatures close to 0 degrees C, which makes them sensitive
	to climatic changes. In Svalbard and northeast Greenland, and also
	in the highest parts of the mountains in the rest of the Nordic area,
	the permafrost is somewhat colder, but still only a few degrees below
	the freezing point. The observations presented from the network of
	boreholes, more than half of which were established during the IPY,
	provide an important baseline to assess how future predicted climatic
	changes may affect the permafrost thermal state in the Nordic area.
	Time series of active-layer thickness and permafrost temperature

  abstract = {The many different existing models describing the spectral behavior
	of the resistivity of geological materials at low frequency, combined
	with the lack of available field data, render the interpretation
	of complex resistivity (CR) data very difficult. With a recent interest
	in CR measurements for environmental applications and thanks to technological
	progress, the use of wide band frequency equipment seems promising,
	and it is expected to shed light on the different results among the
	published solutions to the electromagnetic (EM) coupling problem.
	We review the theory of EM coupling over a homogeneous half-space
	with CR effects and study some aspects of the complex coupling function.
	We advocate the use of the CR based coupling function in the interpretation
	process, in order to obtain a better understanding of the physical
	processes involved in CR effects. Application of the model to real
	field data show systematic good agreement in two simple cases, even
	over wide ranges of frequencies. Interpretation with a double Cole-Cole
	model is applied for comparison, and in spite of good fits to the
	data, large differences are observed in the interpreted low frequency
	dispersion. We conclude that the use of a second Cole-Cole model
	to describe EM coupling may corrupt the interpretation of the low
	frequency dispersion, even when only the normal range of frequencies
	(<100 Hz) is considered, and that the use of the actual EM coupling
	expression is essential when the goal is a better understanding of
	interaction between CR effects and EM coupling.},

	is not well documented. A new coordinated investigation has been
	initiated, for ground temperature measurements and permafrost mapping
	in Greenlandic towns in sporadic, discontinuous and continuous permafrost
	zones. We present investigation results from one of the sites, located
	at Ilulissat, in an area of discontinuous saline permafrost. We have
	established ground temperature measurement stations and conducted
	a shallow geoelectrical study. Our results show that the sediments
	in the studied area mainly consist of very frost susceptible silty
	clays. The area has permafrost with a maximum active layer thickness
	between 0.9 and 1 m. In spite of low permafrost temperatures a considerable
	part of the pore water is unfrozen, due to high residual salt concentrations.
	Consequently, the unfrozen water content dominates the technical
	properties, and the sediments have a limited heat capacity available,
	should the temperature conditions change.},

  abstract = {In 2007 a large Ice dammed lake at the Russel Glacier, near Kangerlussuaq,
	West Greenland, drained in a catastrophic flood event â€“ a j\okulhlaup.
	The draining was made possible by a general retreat of the glacier
	due to climate amelioration. Under normal circumstances such j\okulhlaups
	go relatively unnoticed in Greenland, but in this case the j\okulhlaup
	propagated through a river basin which passes by the main international
	airport in Greenland.
	
	Due to the erosion of the riverbank during the j\okulhlaup, several
	man-made structures were affected â€“ roads disappeared and several
	storage facilities were eroded and destroyed by the river.
	
	In the wake of the catastrophic flood, a previously unknown permafrozen
	fingrained marine deposit was observed in the erosional bank of the
	river. Laboratory studies have proven this material to have extremely
	high sensitivity, with natural water content much higher than the
	liquid limit. 
	
	The formation has been stabilized by the presence of permafrost in
	the area, but the combination of erosional energy supplied by the
	river and the sensitive properties of the material have resulted
	in quick thaw, destabilization and erosion of the formation. As an
	effect, the riverbank was eroded approximately 40 m inland over the
	course of the j\okulhlaup, which lasted approximately one day.
	
	It is the first time such a quick clay formation has been observed
	very near surface in inhabited areas in Greenland. If such deposits
	are found to be more widespread, it could be very problematic for
	the future infrastructural development in the region.
	
	Here we present the results of recent research, including a study
	of mineralogy of the quick clay using SEM and XRD. We also discuss
	the effect of climate warming on permafrost thaw in the area.},
